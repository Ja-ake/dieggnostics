Team 1540 - Flaming Chickens

I've just got some notes here about how the filesystem on the tablets and on the 
flashdrive will work, that way it is not scattered across lots of emails.

Edit AND EMAIL ME if anything here is wrong...

TABLET FILESYSTEM: 
All files in /storage/emulated/legacy/Download folder:
      schemas/:
          1540-02-21-2015-14-05-44.txt
          XXXX-MM-DD-YYYY-hh-mm-ss.txt !!!Time is always in 24 hour format!
      unmodnotes/:
          //Do not edit anything in here, just copy modified notes over to modnotes/
          1540.txt
          XXXX.txt
      modnotes/:
          //This will be blank after I sync with tablet, move unmod note over here when you modify it.
          1540.txt
          XXXX.txt
      schedule.txt - match schedule
      sched.txt - identical match schedule, we never decided on which one to use
      teams.txt - Team names for that competition in the format 1540:The Flaming Chickens\n
      settings.txt - Settings file with this format- "tabletRole,matchNumber,competitionID" where tablet role is 0-5 for Red1 Red2 Red3 Blue1..., matchNumber is the mostt recent match number, and competitionID is something like "2015orosu"


FLASHDRIVE FILESYSTEM:
All flashdrives will be named "COMPANAL" in the MS-DOS/FAT32 format.
On a Mac, they mount at /Volumes/COMPANAL/
On Ubuntu, they mount at /media/username/COMPANAL where username is probably "flaming"
COMPANAL/:
      schedule.txt - match schedule
      sched.txt - identical match schedule, we never decided on which one to use
      teams.txt - Team names for that competition in the format 1540:The Flaming Chickens\n
      schemas/:
          1540-02-21-2015-14-05-44.txt
          XXXX-MM-DD-YYYY-hh-mm-ss.txt !!!Time is always in 24 hour format!
      notes/:
          1540.txt
          XXXX.txt
      procschemas/:
          //This directory contains my "processed" schemas for the coaches app. Conner, if you want to know what these are, let me know. They might be useful for you.
          1540.json
          XXXX.json
